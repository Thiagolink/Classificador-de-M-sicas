# Classificador-de-Musicas-Spotify

Using data from the Spotify API, I try to make the predctions about the genre of music. In this process I clean the data, make feature engineering, try classification with 4 types os model's, use clustering to see if match the number of existing class and in the end I use an ensemble with the best results of every model used in the classfication.
